## Simple MineSweeper Game made in java

This was originally made to be used in the SHPE Java workshop but unfortunately we ran out of time. 

Classes:
  MineSweeper: Contains all of the logic for the game
  Main: Test class

Please feel free to use this code however you like!


The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
